CLUSTERING OF COPENHAGEN STATIONS

Following decades of urban development, it is worthwhile to take a snapshot of the current development of areas surrounding metro and train stations and classify them into groups.

Some neighbourhoods are commonly known, especially for Copenhagen residents, as mostly residential, others have more business and commercial spaces surrounding them. The purpose of this work is to let data tell the story.

The venues closest to a station determine how people are using these spaces, e.g. if there are low counts of professional places in a neighbourhood then its residents are likely to commute to other areas for work. This creates daily movement of people
